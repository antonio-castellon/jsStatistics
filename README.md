# jsStatistics
A short implementation in Javascript from Statistics based on JAVA Apache Commons Math 3.4.1 API

> The idea is to add each required feature from the current implementations in the Commons Math API from JAVA, in order to be used by any browser and NodeJS server as a simple javascript library.

> In my case, the reason to generate this libraries was that not exists any jscript library that offer the *t-test* implementation based on (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_t_test) that is used on MS Excel or SAS Application
