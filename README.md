# jsStatistics
A short implementation in Javascript from Statistics based on JAVA Apache Commons Math 3.4.1 API

> The idea is to add each required features implemented on the Apache Commons Math library, in order to be used by any browser and/or any NodeJS server as a simple javascript library.

> The reason to generate these libraries was because not exists any jscript library that offer the *t-test* implementation based on (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_t_test) which it is used on MS Excel or SAS Application.
